I joined the [University of Texas at Austin](https://utexas.edu) Fall of 2022 to pursue my PhD in Materials Science and Engineering, where I am studying defect complexes using computational methods with [Prof. Wennie Wang](https://www.che.utexas.edu/people/faculty/wang) as my principal advisor

I obtained my BS in Chemistry from [Texas A&M University](http://tamu.edu/) in December 2021, where I researched under [Prof. Lei Fang in the Department of Chemistry](https://www.chem.tamu.edu/rgroup/fang/), working on superhydrophobic materials.

Upon graduating from Texas A&M, I worked as an organic chemist at [American Biochemicals](https://www.americanbiochemicals.com/) where we worked on custom organic synthesis, purification, and characterization.

<h2>Research Interests</h2>

<p>

My focus is on the revolutionary potential of memristors, particularly those using two-dimensional (2D) materials. Memristors offer significant advantages in capacity and energy efficiency. Within this context, I am exploring atomically-thin monolayer materials as the ultimate material scaling limit for high capacity. A core challenge is the variability in reported switching behaviors in 2D materials, emphasizing the need for a comprehensive understanding of defect complexes. My overarching goal is to expedite the application of 2D materials in memristive technologies. This involves computer-assisted predictions for materials with low switching energy, identification of optimal materials for memristor devices, and creating computational tools for understanding defects in 2D materials. My approach integrates insights from outside the memristor community and leverages computational workflows to accelerate materials exploration and understand energy switching. The potential outcomes of my research span energy-efficient memristors, and the broader application of 2D materials in various fields including quantum information and neuromorphic computing
